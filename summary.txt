The project titled "Comprehensive Analysis of IPL Data (2008â€“2025)" by Mathi Priyan A M from Thiagarajar College of Engineering provides a detailed exploration of IPL datasets sourced from Kaggle, covering seasons from 2008 to 2020. Using match-level (matches.csv) and ball-by-ball (deliveries.csv) data, the project aims to uncover patterns in team performance, toss decisions, venues, and scoring trends. Data preprocessing involved cleaning missing values, standardizing team names, formatting dates, engineering features like run rates and match phases, and validating for consistency. Key insights include that Mumbai Indians won the most tosses and matches, while Rising Pune Supergiants had the highest win percentage due to fewer games. Home venues generally favored teams, with Royal Challengers Bangalore and Chennai Super Kings frequently scoring 200+ runs. The project also includes a predictive model using logistic regression to forecast match winners based on features like venue, toss, powerplay runs, and batting order. A sample prediction showed that Chennai Super Kings were likely to win when chasing at Wankhede with strong powerplay performance. Overall, the analysis combines statistical trends with machine learning to offer actionable insights into IPL dynamics.
